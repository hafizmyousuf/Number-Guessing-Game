# Number Guessing Game with Difficulty Levels

## Overview

This Python project is a number guessing game where the player selects a difficulty level and tries to guess a randomly chosen number. The game provides feedback after each guess and allows the player to choose to play again after guessing the correct number.

## How to Play

1. The player selects a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: Guess a number between 1 and 100.
   - **Medium**: Guess a number between 1 and 500.
   - **Hard**: Guess a number between 1 and 2000.
   
2. The computer generates a random number based on the selected difficulty level.
3. The player is prompted to guess the number.
4. The program will inform the player if their guess is too high or too low after each attempt.
5. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
6. After guessing correctly, the player is given the option to play again or exit the game.
